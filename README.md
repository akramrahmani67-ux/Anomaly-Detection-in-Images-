# Enhancing Image Anomaly Detection: A Hybrid Framework with Pre-Trained Models and Sequential Neural Networks
Anomaly detection in images is crucial for visual surveillance and industrial inspection. 
Traditional methods often struggle with subtle or context-aware anomalies.
This paper introduces a hybrid framework combining pre-trained vision models, sequence networks (LSTM and GRU), and the explainable Grad-CAM++ mechanism. 
Our approach significantly outperforms existing literature-based models, achieving an AUC of up to 100% on certain datasets, and provides accurate localization of anomalous regions. 
The integration of spatial-temporal modeling and gradient-based explanation enhances both accuracy and transparency.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets (UCSD Ped1, Ped2, Avenue, and UMN) demonstrate the superiority of our method, confirming its effectiveness in capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies.
