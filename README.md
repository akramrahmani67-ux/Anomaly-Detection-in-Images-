# Anomaly Detection in Images
# Enhancing Image Anomaly Detection: A Hybrid Framework with Pre-Trained Models and Sequential Neural Networks
 <p>Anomaly detection in images is crucial for visual surveillance and industrial inspection. Traditional methods often struggle with subtle or context-aware anomalies.</p>

<p>This paper introduces a hybrid framework combining:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-trained vision models</li>
  <li>Sequence networks (LSTM and GRU)</li>
  <li>The explainable Grad-CAM++ mechanism</li>
</ul>

<p>Our approach significantly outperforms existing literature-based models, achieving an AUC of up to 100% on certain datasets, while providing accurate localization of anomalous regions. The integration of spatial-temporal modeling and gradient-based explanation enhances both accuracy and transparency.</p>

<p>Experimental results on four benchmark datasets (<strong>UCSD Ped1, Ped2, Avenue, and UMN</strong>) demonstrate the superiority of our method, confirming its effectiveness in capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies.</p>

## ‚ö° Feature Extractors

The following pre-trained models were used for feature extraction:

| Model       | Anomaly Features                  | Normal Features                  |
|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| CoatNet    | `anomaly_features_coatnet_0_rw_224.npy` | `normal_features_coatnet_0_rw_224.npy` |
| ConvNeXt   | `anomaly_features_convnext_tiny.npy` | `normal_features_convnext_tiny.npy` |
| MaxViT     | `anomaly_features_maxvit_tiny_tf_224.npy` | `normal_features_maxvit_tiny_tf_224.npy` |
| MobileOne  | `anomaly_features_mobileone_s0.npy` | `normal_features_mobileone_s0.npy` |
| PoolFormer | `anomaly_features_poolformer_s12.npy` | `normal_features_poolformer_s12.npy` |
| RepVGG     | `anomaly_features_repvgg_a0.npy` |`normal_features_repvgg_a0.npy`   |

These models are CNN-based or hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures and are used to extract meaningful features from both normal and anomalous frames.
