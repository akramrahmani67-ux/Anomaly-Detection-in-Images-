# Anomaly Detection in Images
# Enhancing Image Anomaly Detection: A Hybrid Framework with Pre-Trained Models and Sequential Neural Networks
 <p>Anomaly detection in images is crucial for visual surveillance and industrial inspection. Traditional methods often struggle with subtle or context-aware anomalies.</p>

<p>This paper introduces a hybrid framework combining:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-trained vision models</li>
  <li>Sequence networks (LSTM and GRU)</li>
  <li>The explainable Grad-CAM++ mechanism</li>
</ul>

<p>Our approach significantly outperforms existing literature-based models, achieving an AUC of up to 100% on certain datasets, while providing accurate localization of anomalous regions. The integration of spatial-temporal modeling and gradient-based explanation enhances both accuracy and transparency.</p>

<p>Experimental results on four benchmark datasets (<strong>UCSD Ped1, Ped2, Avenue, and UMN</strong>) demonstrate the superiority of our method, confirming its effectiveness in capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies.</p>
